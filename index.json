LCP has a significant impact on the enhancement of language translations, readability assessment, and text generation. However, the domain-specific technical word, the complex grammatical structure, the polysemy problem, the inter-word relationship, and dependencies make it challenging to determine the complexity of words or phrases. In this paper, we propose an integrated transformer regressor model named ITRM-LCP to estimate the lexical complexity of words and phrases where diverse contextual features are extracted from various transformer models. The transformer models are fine-tuned using the text-pair data. Then, a bidirectional LSTM-based regressor module is plugged on top of each transformer to learn the long-term dependencies and estimate the complexity scores. The predicted scores of each module are then aggregated to determine the final complexity score. We assess our proposed model using two benchmark datasets from shared tasks. Experimental findings demonstrate that our ITRM-LCP model obtains 10.2% and 8.2% improvement on the news and Wikipedia corpus of the CWI-2018 dataset, compared to the top-performing systems (DAT, CAMB, and TMU). Additionally, our ITRM-LCP model surpasses state-of-the-art LCP systems (DeepBlueAI, JUST-BLUE) by 1.5% and 1.34% for single and multi-word LCP tasks defined in the SemEval LCP-2021 task.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging contextual representations with BiLSTM-based regressor for lexical complexity prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abdul Aziz","Nihad Karim Chowdhury","Muhammad Ashad Kabir","Abu Nowshed Chy","Md.

Understanding human desire has the potential to be one of the most fascinating and challenging research domains. It is tightly coupled with sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks. It is beneficial for increasing human-computer interactions, recognizing human emotional intelligence, understanding interpersonal relationships, and making decisions. However, understanding human desire is challenging and under-explored because ways of eliciting desire might be different among humans. The task gets more difficult due to the diverse cultures, countries, and languages. Prior studies overlooked the use of image-text pairwise feature representation, which is crucial for the task of human desire understanding. In this research, we have proposed a unified multimodal transformer-based framework with image-text pair settings to identify human desire, sentiment, and emotion. The core of our proposed method lies in the encoder module, which is built using two state-of-the-art multimodal transformer models. These models allow us to extract diverse features. To effectively extract visual and contextualized embedding features from social media image and text pairs, we conducted joint fine-tuning of two pre-trained multimodal transformer models: Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and Vision-and-Augmented-Language Transformer (VAuLT). Subsequently, we use an early fusion strategy on these embedding features to obtain combined diverse feature representations of the image-text pair. This consolidation incorporates diverse information about this task, enabling us to robustly perceive the context and image pair from multiple perspectives. Moreover, we leverage a multi-sample dropout mechanism to enhance the generalization ability and expedite the training process of our proposed method. To evaluate our proposed approach, we used the multimodal dataset MSED for the human desire understanding task. Through our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our method excels in capturing both visual and contextual information, resulting in superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches by 3% for sentiment analysis, 2.2% for emotion analysis, and approximately 1% for desire analysis.","tags":[],"title":"MMTF-DES: A Fusion of Multimodal Transformer Models for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abu Nowshed Chy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1695254400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1695254400,"objectID":"40671d19cd13ede17745f7a2243caef4","permalink":"https://cardiffnlp.github.io/post/2023-09-21/","publishdate":"2023-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-09-21/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Congratulations to Akram, Aziz, Nabila, Radia, Afrin, Tahsin, Piyal, and Fareen for successfully completing their undergraduate studies!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Abdul Aziz","Md.

To address these challenges, CASE-2023 introduced a shared task 3 with two subtasks focusing on event causality identification with causal news corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate our participant systems for this task. We leverage two transformers models including DeBERTa and Twitter-RoBERTa along with the weighted average fusion technique to tackle the challenges of subtask 1 where we need to identify whether a text belongs to either causal or not. For subtask 2 where we need to identify the cause, effect, and signal tokens from the text, we proposed a unified neural network of DeBERTa and DistilRoBERTa transformer variants with contrastive learning techniques.

This paper describes our participation in the CASE 2023 multimodal hate speech event detection task. In this task, the objective is to automatically detect hate speech and its target from the given textembedded image. We proposed a transformerbased multimodal hierarchical fusion model to detect hate speech present in the visual content. We jointly fine-tune a language and a vision pre-trained transformer models to extract the visual-contextualized features representation of the text-embedded image. We concatenate these features and fed them to the multisample dropout strategy. Moreover, the contextual feature vector is fed into the BiLSTM module and the output of the BiLSTM module also passes into the multi-sample dropout. We employed arithmetic mean fusion to fuse all sample dropout outputs that predict the final label of our proposed method.

However, the diversity of word semantics and sentence structure makes it challenging to determine the causal relationship effectively. To address these challenges, CASE-2022 shared task 3 introduced a task focusing on event causality identification with causal news corpus. This paper presents our participation in this task, especially in subtask 1 which is the causal event classification task. To tackle the task challenge, we propose a unified neural model through exploiting two fine-tuned transformer models including RoBERTa and Twitter-RoBERTa. For the score fusion, we combine the prediction scores of each component model using weighted arithmetic mean to generate the probability score for class label identification. The experimental results showed that our proposed method achieved the top performance (ranked 1st) among the participants.","tags":[],"title":"CSECU-DSG@ Causal News Corpus 2022: Fusion of RoBERTa Transformers Variants for Causal Event Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md.

The extraction of causal-relations from texts might be beneficial for the improvement of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including Q/A, text-summarization, opinion mining, and event analysis. However, cause-effect relation in the text is sparse, ambiguous, sometimes implicit, and has a linguistically complex construct. To address these challenges FIRE-2020 introduced a shared task focusing on cause-effect relation extraction (CEREX). We propose a feature based supervised classification model with a naive rule-based classifier. We define a set of rules based on a causal connective dictionary and stop-words. Besides, we use a fusion of hand-crafted features and transfer learning embeddings to train our SVM based supervised classification model.
